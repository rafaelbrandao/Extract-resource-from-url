This is a very simple application using QtWebkit. It's purpose is to monitor what resources are loaded when you're loading a specific url, and then grab whatever it might be of your interest for you to handle. Here's how it's supposed to be used:

USAGE: [--url URL] [--pattern PAT] [--command CMD] [--timeout SEC] 
--url URL: Asks crawler to look for resources at URL. 
--pattern PAT: If a resource has PAT as substring, then it'll be caught by this crawler. 
--command CMD: As soon as it opens a url, it will call javascript CMD to possibly trigger some resource load (which you're interested) on that page. 
--timeout SEC: Wait SEC seconds for a page load and then trigger the javascript command (if there's any). It would also wait SEC seconds after that trigger and then finish it. 

Once you get this, you should run 'qmake', and then 'make' to generate code and executable.
Then you can run it with './resource-from-url [pars]'.

Here's a small example of usage (and the results):
$ ./resource-from-url --url "http://qt.nokia.com" --pattern "jquery"
FOUND: "http://qt.nokia.com/portal_javascripts/Qt Theme 2010/jquery-cachekey2590.js" 
FOUND: "http://qt.nokia.com/portal_javascripts/Qt Theme 2010/jquery-integration-cachekey8188.js" 
FOUND: "http://qt.nokia.com/portal_javascripts/Qt Theme 2010/jquery.prettyPhoto-cachekey2902.js" 
FOUND: "http://qt.nokia.com/portal_javascripts/Qt Theme 2010/jquery.tools.min-cachekey7312.js"
